NAME
    DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::IP - Auto-create NetAddr::IP objects from
    columns.

SYNOPSIS
    Load this component and declare columns as IP addresses with the
    appropriate format.

        package Host;
        __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/InflateColumn::IP Core/);
        __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
            ip_address => {
                data_type => 'bigint',
                is_nullable => 0,
                is_ip => 1,
                ip_format => 'numeric',
            }
        );

        package Network;
        __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/InflateColumn::IP Core/);
        __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
            address => {
                data_type => 'varchar',
                size        => 18
                is_nullable => 0,
                is_ip => 1,
                ip_format => 'cidr',
            }
        );

    Then you can treat the specified column as a NetAddr::IP object.

        print 'IP address: ', $host->ip_address->addr;
        print 'Address type: ', $host->ip_address->iptype;

    DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::IP supports a limited amount of
    auto-detection of the format based on the column type. If the type
    begins with "int" or "bigint", it's assumed to be numeric, while "inet"
    and "cidr" (as used by e.g. PostgreSQL) are assumed to be "cidr" format.

METHODS
  ip_class
    Arguments: $class

    Gets/sets the address class that the columns should be inflated into.
    The default class is NetAddr::IP.

  ip_format
    Arguments: $format

    Gets/sets the name of the method used to deflate the address for the
    database. This must return a value suitable for "$ip_class-"new(); The
    default format is "addr", which returns the address in dotted-quad
    notation. See "Methods" in NetAddr::IP for suitable values.

  register_column
    Chains with "register_column" in DBIx::Class::Row, and sets up IP
    address columns appropriately. This would not normally be called
    directly by end users.
